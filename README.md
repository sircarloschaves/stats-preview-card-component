## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

For me so far this has been the most difficult component, I have a serious problem when dealing with the positioning of the content within the card, as you can see, I had to use 'hacks' with padding to keep the positioning as close as possible to the original, However, I believe it is not the best practice. I had to do some effort and research to choose the method I would use to create the colored overlay above the image.
